                <p>
                    Graceful labelings are the topic of some very imfamous theorems and
                    unsolved problems in the field of graph theory. Like many other problems
                    in graph theory, graceful labelings are deceptively simple, hiding
                    much anguish and suffer behinds its relatively simple definition.
                    The problem at the center of this topic, the Ringel-Kotzig conjecture,
                    or more typically the Graceful Tree Conjecture (GTC) was famously
                    described as being a "disease" for the field, which makes it a
                    fantastic topic to research.

                <p>What is a graceful labeling?</p>
                <h3> Formally </h3>
                <p>
                    Given a graph \(G\) on \(n\) vertices, a vertex labeling is a
                    injective function \( \phi:V(G) \rightarrow \{0, \dots, n-1\}\).
                    A <i>graceful labeling</i> (also called a \(\beta\)-valuation) is 
                    a injective function \( \psi:E(G) \rightarrow \{1, \dots, n\} \) such 
                    that for any edge \(e=uv \in E(G)\), we have that
                    \( \psi(e) = | \phi(u) - \phi(v) |\).
                </p>
                <h3> Informally </h3>
                <p>
                    Consider a graph \(G\) on \(n\) vertices, and we give each vertex a distinct
                    label, going from 0 to \(n-1\). For example, if we have 4 vertices, then our labels
                    for the vertices of \(G\) are \(\{0,1,2,3\}\). Now, suppose that we take the labels
                    for two adjacent vertices, that is two vertices which lie on the same edge,
                    and we take the absolute different of their labels. The idea behind a graceful
                    labeling is that, if we are <i>really</i> careful about how we assign our
                    vertex labels, then the absolute differences between the vertices on
                    each edge will form the sequence \(\{1,2,\dots,n\}\), meaning that no
                    two edges will have the same difference.

                <h2> Graceful Tree Conjecture </h2>
                <p> 
                    As I said earlier, most problems in graph theory are deceptively simple, that is they can
                    be easy to understand, but hide much of their complexity in the details. The Graceful Tree Conjecture
                    is one of those problems. The Graceful Tree Conjecture is simple this: 
                </p>
                <h4>
                    <b>Conjecture. </b> <i> Every tree has a graceful labeling </i>
                </h4>
                <p>
                    To be clear about earlier, this is not the case for graphs in general. In fact, if you draw out any
                    arbitrary graph on paper, you'll find out quickly that it can be <i>very</i> difficult to find
                    a graceful labeling for it. However, the claim here is that if you draw specifically a tree,
                    that no matter what you can find a graceful labeling.
