                        On December 3, 2024, South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law. 
                        He did so at 10:27pm KST. The day was ending, people were asleep, and most importantly,
                        the members of the Korean National Assembly were absent. This was intentional; Yoon wanted
                        this to pass unnoticed for as long as possible. The declaration itself was a "hail mary" of
                        sorts, it was justified based on rumors and superstition held by Yoon, and only Yoon.
                        His hand was poorly played. Not only was there immediate widespread protest from civilians, 
                        but 190 members of the National Assembly showed up at 1:00am to overrule the President's 
                        decision. So, after roughly 6 hours, martial law was lifted. On December 14, 2024, Yoon
                        Suk Yeol was impeached and his presidential powers were suspended. 
                        A trial is currently underway. If the courts uphold his impeachment, he will be removed from office.

                        On December 8, 2024, Syria's government was overthrown. The previous day, opposition forces
                        surrounded Syria's capital, Damascus, which was followed by the rapid surrender of the Syrian army.
                        President Bashar al-Assad then fled the country, at which point victory was declared. 
                        Assad's family had ruled Syria for over 50 years. Bashar al-Assad's regime in particular 
                        was characterized by totalitarianism, repression, and human rights abuses. 
                        As of today, a new constitution is being written, and the current
                        transitional government has announced their plans to adopt policies of economic liberalization
                        and to prioritize human and judicial rights. The mundane has set in.

                        Beneath the uncanny shock of a person this wealthy being killed in such a gruesome, human way,
                        there is the even more interesting reaction taking place. Rather than outrage, in the depths of Twitter
                        posts, Reddit threads, and Tik Tok comments, you instead find support, jokes, and defense in favor of
                        the assassin. The last decade of American politics has been notable for our passionate, and at
                        time violent reaction to unjust murder. The obvious example here is the murder of George Floyd in
                        May 2020 by a police officer, which was followed by weeks of protests, riots, and news coverage.
                        Many were rightfully upset over how something like this could happen, and demanded that those
                        responsible be held accountable for their crimes.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This makes it all the more interesting that now, in this case, we are seeing the opposite reaction. 
                        It is almost impossible to escape the memes about how attractive the assassin is, the jokes following
                        his capture that hinted at his innocence, and most importantly the genuine commentary from regular
                        people talking about their negative experiences with health insurance. Alarmingly, many have
                        dared to pose the question: was this murder justified?

                        On one hand, UnitedHealth is undoubtedly guilty of some bad things. UnitedHealth's denial rate is double
                        the average among other health insurance providers. They are accused of using faulty algorithms and 
                        artificial intelligence programs to handle claims, which according to lawsuits have resulted in
                        several unjust deaths. They have been accused and sued for fraud, insider trading, and stealing 
                        money from Medicare. In the process of prioritizing profits, UnitedHealth has caused and 
                        is responsible for the suffering of thousands of people. Those proclaiming support for the assassin
                        do so out of anger and frustration with the private healthcare industry in the United States. For once,
                        rather than seeing the rich and wealthy succeed, it comes as a welcome relief to see the people
                        who have suffered under their rule fighting back and winning for a change. Why, when a soldier or a police
                        officer kills a criminal, we call them heroes, but when a civilian does the same we charge them
                        with murder?

                        But these are the actions of the company UnitedHealth, not the personal decisions of Brain Thompson.
                        Thompson was CEO for many bad decisions made by UnitedHealth, yes, but just how many of these did he
                        personally play a hand in? Sure, he's the CEO, and everything that happens under your company as
                        leader is, by extension, your fault, but is that enough to condemn him to death? After all, there
                        are lawsuits underway regarding many of these decisions, so the company will, likely, be punished
                        for their unethical decisions, so why did he have to die? Besides, we believe in the rule of law.
                        If someone commits a crime, they should be fairly tried before a jury and given a fair punishment
                        according to their crime. This isn't the wild west, we don't romanticize vigilantes anymore.

                        We live in a time where the rich and powerful can do anything they want and get away with
                        everything. Donald Trump, despite his desperate attempts to undermine democracy in this country,
                        get reelected anyways. Elon Musk, a billionaire who wasn't even born in this 
                        country, can buy his way into the president's office and manipulate politics to benefit himself.
                        Since when are South Koreans and Syrians better at fighting authoritarianism than Americans? 
                        We defined ourselves for years by our ability to do so. Do the people even have 
                        the ability anymore to fight against tyranny? The 2nd amendment was put into
                        the Bill of Rights for this purpose, but in the age of drones and tanks and private 
                        militaries, how could we hope to stand a chance?

                        But where does this put us? We are no closer to destroying capitalism now than we were earlier.
                        These are systemic issues that will take decades to resolve. What we are left with now is a dead man,
                        one who left behind a wife and kids. And think of the optics! Will this really garner support 
                        for the cause? Violence does not often breed sympathy for the victims, especially not in 
                        any democratic society. Sure, the situation was different is Syria, but South Koreans handled
                        their tyranny efficiently and justly, no killings necessary. Why can't we do the same?

                        Trump's election is emblematic of why we must change how we fight. The incoming administration
                        will exist in opposition to the benefit of common people. You can't trust a ship anymore than
                        you trust the captain. Our government was designed to be difficult to change, and things are
                        moving fast, and we have deadlines. Our cynicism is the product of our institutions. Our nihilism is
                        the result of this equation. How can we be expected to care about people who routinely place
                        their lives about ours? They'd let us die to make a profit, so at what point do we start
                        respecting ourselves and take action?

                        “One of the great ironies of how democracies die is that the very defense of democracy 
                        is often used as a pretext for its subversion. Would-be autocrats often use economic crises, 
                        natural disasters, and especially security threats—wars, armed insurgencies, or terrorist 
                        attacks—to justify antidemocratic measures.” - Steven Levitsky, Daniel Ziblatt

                        Regardless of the interpretation, this event is indicative of the much greater issue affecting
                        American politics, on both sides. Our government is no longer viewed as being capable of
                        managing our lives. Again, I believe this is the same reason why Trump was elected again
                        in the first place. This frustration from everyone on the playing field will eventually
                        boil over into something worse, one way or the other. Guess we will have to wait and see.
