                    This was the second book of Murakami's that I've read, the first being <i>Kafka on the Shore</i>.
                    I first read <i>Kafka</i> 3 years ago, and I immediately fell in love with it.
                    Murakami writes in a introspective yet down-to-earth manner that I find to be
                    profoundly beautiful. What I found the most captivating about that book was
                    Murakami's ability to touch on many deeply personal topics with such delicacy and
                    realism. You feel as though Murakami is a wise old man, who is guiding you, the
                    reader, through his characters lives, showing you their mistakes and misery,
                    while reassuring you everything will be alright in the end, as if giving you
                    a lesson on life inspired by his own trials and tribulations.

                <p style="text-indent: 4em">
                    <i>Kafka on the Shore</i> is generally regarded as Murakami's second or third most popular
                    book, trading places perhaps with either <i>1Q84</i> or <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i>.
                    His most popular book, however, is without a doubt <i>Norwegian Wood</i>. It is often
                    credited as the book which made Murakami famous. This is despite the fact that,
                    among fans and even Murakami himself, <i>Norwegian Wood</i> is considered to be one of
                    his weaker books. And while <i>Norwegian Wood</i> is far from being a bad book, it does
                    have its flaws as compared to <i>Kafka</i>. That being said, <i>Norwegian Wood</i> is
                    still unmistakably Murakami's, and is just as deep and insightful as <i>Kafka</i>.

                <p style="text-indent: 4em">
                    <i>Norwegian Wood</i> is characterized by its rather simple plot. Murakami has stated
                    that this book started as a challenge for himself, to see if he could deviate
                    from the complex narratives which he was known for and create something just as 
                    profound while comparatively straight-forward. The book follows Toru Watanabe during
                    his college years. He is friends with and falls in love with a girl named Naoko. Naoko
                    was the girlfriend of Toru's best friend, Kizuki, who committed suicide some
                    years prior to their reunion once Toru began college. We follow Toru over the course
                    of two years, as he goes through bursts of loneliness and constant alcoholism, and
                    as Naoko slowly falls deeper and deeper down a hole filled with mental issues 
                    stemming from Kizuki's suicide, eventually culminating in her own suicide by the end
                    of the book.     
                </p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-indent: 4em">
                    The heart of this book comes from the details surrounding Toru and Naoko's relationship.
                    Behind Toru's love for Naoko is his grief for the death of Kizuki. Toru holds on to
                    the memory of his friend through Naoko. His grief and trauma resulting from his suicide
                    affects Toru's entire personality, or rather is lack thereof.  Some criticize the book 
                    for this aspect, but upon reflection it feels like an intention part of the story.
                    Kizuki's death marks the beginning of a life surrounded by death for Toru. Soaked in
                    the tragedy of his death, Toru is emotionally distant and alienated from the people
                    around him. Kizuki was Toru's only friend, and so once he looses this anchor to the 
                    rest of the world, Toru takes on this new, blank personality.     
                </p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-indent: 4em">
                    Similarly for Naoko, Kizuki's death slowly eats away at her mental health. In the 
                    last sentence of the first chapter, Toru makes the realization, many years after the events
                    of the book, that Naoko never loved him. Arguably, throughout the book, Naoko
                    is still in love with Naoko. This correlates with the escalation of her and Toru's 
                    relationship, as once they become more intimate, her mental health becomes far worse.
                    Naoko remarks to Toru that he reminds her too much of Kizuki, and this is ultimately
                    the reason for her worsening mental state. While Toru is trying to remain close
                    to the memory of Kizuki by being with Naoko, Naoko cannot escape his memory, although
                    apart of her doesn't want to, despite it being the only path for her recovery.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-indent: 4em">
                    This dynamic is why Naoko decides to end her life in the finale of the book. The side
                    plot of the book has Toru fall in love with another woman, Midori, which becomes 
                    an open fact between him and Naoko. Naoko is aware of the fact that Toru is resisting
                    his urge to pursue his relationship with Midori out of an obligation towards her.
                    Naoko therefore kills herself for two reasons. Firstly, to release Toru of his
                    connected to her, and thus Kizuki, allowing him to grow as a person. Secondly, her suicide
                    is a submission to her love for Kizuki, and so kills herself to join him in death. Arguably,
                    contrary to Toru's realization, I interpret this as an act of love by Naoko.
                    Why Toru sees it differently, I'm not sure. Another interpretation of her suicide
                    I found was that Naoko was incapable of love, which explains why Kizuki commits
                    suicide during their relationship. It is once she makes this observation about herself
                    upon beginning her relationship with Toru that her mental health declines, eventually
                    leading to her committing suicide out of guilt. While interesting, I don't
                    think this is supported by the text, especially since it undermines the theme
                    of accepting death as apart of life and being able to learn and grow from it.
                    It's more likely that the part about Naoko mistreating Kizuki is real, which could
                    add to her decision to end her life, as she doesn't want to make the same
                    mistake with Toru, expressing her love for him.

                    As stated, this book is not without its flaws. As widely observed, the female characters
                    of this book come off as shallow and/or incompetent. The character most blatantly guilty
                    of this is Midori, Toru's second lover. Her only real character trait is being overtly
                    horny, which isn't interesting or fun to read. She does have one great monologue,
                    critiquing the leftist-marxist movement at their school for being insincere
                    and only existing as a popularity contest for men to seduce young women who are
                    too stupid to understand what they're talking about. Besides this one tidbit, Midori
                    is a mostly static character that exists solely to add complexity to Toru and Naoko's
                    relationship. I took notes following each chapter of the book while reading it, and the 
                    chapters involving Toru and Midori exclusively I had nothing or almost nothing
                    of note to write down.

                    In the same vein, the other point this book is most often criticized for is being
                    far too sexual. <i>Kafka of the Shore</i> did not stray away from sexuality either,
                    so I had expected it when I started this book. However, while the sexual segments of
                    <i>Kafka</i> felt meaningful and emotional, representing some deeper emotion going
                    on within the characters, often times in <i>Norwegian Wood</i> felt either forced
                    and unnecessary, or just a shallow imitation of the ones from <i>Kafka</i>. I should
                    state the obvious, which is that sex is of course an important part of these stories,
                    and I don't think that they should be removed by any means, especially when they
                    can be so beautifully written thanks to Murakami. That being said, I think that 
                    Murakami forgets what makes sex so important and impactful in his other works
                    in this book, so they often don't contribute much to the story other than
                    to reduce or trivialize certain characters interactions.

                    Overall, I'd give <i>Norwegian Wood</i> an 8/10. I enjoyed it, but I'm
                    not as excited to reread this one as I am <i>Kafka on the Shore</i>.
