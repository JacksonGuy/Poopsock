            <p> 
                This page is dedicated to tracking every horrible decision that
                Donald Trump makes during his tenure as 47th president of the
                United States of America.

            <p>
                I will be recording the actions of the Trump administration on
                a day-by-day basis for the next 4 years, just to ensure that every
                moron fascist in this country understands just how disgusting and 
                idiotic their decision was to elect that rapist-misogynist-felon
                piece of shit. 
            </p>
