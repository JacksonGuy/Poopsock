            <br><br>
            <div class="row">
                <p style="text-indent: 4em; font-size: 28px;">
                    This last week following the results of the 2024 presidential election has been defined both by a period self-reflection
                    by Democrats and controversy by Republicans. Trump's presidency has hardly yet began, and even in this brief glimpse
                    of what's to come, we have witnessed nothing but a variety of horrible decision regarding his cabinet and suggestions of 
                    new policies which may-or-may-not which promise to betray the people of this country. 
                    In any case, that's a topic for another time, once the dust has settled and we have a more concrete view of his administration.

                        What I actually want to focus on is the self-reflection. Understandably, many prominent figures within the Democratic party
                        have expresses some amount of desire to "change" the party; to understand why we've failed to win and adjust our strategy
                        to avoid future losses and, of course, better represent the American people. The debate has two fronts, the ideological
                        debate and the demographic debate. In short, on one hand you have a conversation about what direction should the party
                        move in, either left or right, and on the other hand you have the question of what group of people should the Democratic
                        party be targeting. Both sides are contingent on the belief that change within the party is, in fact, the answer to our
                        problems. And of course if you're a political party rather than an ideological one, that is naturally the answer. Your 
                        responsibility is not to represent any particular set of beliefs, but to represent the people and their beliefs.

                <div class="col-8">
                    <p style="text-indent: 4em; font-size: 24px">
                        I want to focus in on the necessity of change at all. Government, first and foremost, has the responsibility to improve 
                        the lives of the people which it governs, which it then has to balance with the political desire to keep people happy.
                        Unfortunately, these goals do not always intersect each other. The awful reality of democracy is that the people don't always
                        know (in some metaphysical sense, supposing such an answer exists) what is best for them. Not everyone has the 
                        ability to recognize and distinguish between what <i>feels</i> better, and what is <i>actually</i> better. 
                        This is what makes demagogues like Donald Trump so dangerous; Trump's ability to exploit the emotions of his misinformed 
                        political base, stoking fear and hate to advance his cause, makes him a rhetorically effective political leader among the casually political. 
                        That being said, when this is your opposition, how do you properly address defeat? Better yet, how do you combat the type of 
                        narrative pushed by Donald Trump without resorting to the same behavior?

                I've found that there is a certain burden in arguing positions to Republicans. The difficult reality is that often the most
                "correct" opinion require the most work to reach, and usually when confronted with this dilemma most people 
                choose the more intuitive and "natural" explanation, even if it means being wrong. It's easier to blame economic 
                problems on immigrants than to read a dense and technical academic paper reviewing trade policies. Conservatives,
                naturally, thrive on simple yet incorrect explanations of the world. 
                To progress society requires progressive thought, which requires effort and a particular creativity of thought that 
                being social conservative definitionally lacks. Not that progressive thought is inherently more correct than
                conservative thought, just that it happens to be so more often than not. To return to politics, the big question for 
                Democrats going forward will be how do you advocate for progressive policy without categorically rejecting the concerns of half
                the country? And can you maintain objectivity while doing so?

                That being said, the question of what direction should the Democratic party move in following this election is complicated.
                You can't responsibility move to closer to the center without sacrificing the well-being of Americans, and you can't shift
                further to the left without losing more voters, forever dooming the country to Republican rule and thus again 
                sacrificing the well-being of the country. So how do you target a population of people that is, to be blunt, less educated, 
                while not outright ignoring them? Do you even have an obligation to do so?

                        Ideally, the solution is to take a more grassroots approach over the next four years and engage in a collective effort to educate
                        the people of America. But more likely than not, this will turn out to be wishful thinking. People are suborn, careless,
                        and especially as of late, anti-intellectual, traits which makes this task near impossible. We may have to live with the
                        unfortunate reality that an entire generation of Americans have been permanently ruined by conservative thought. Perhaps
                        we may not have anything to do, and Donald Trump will do all the work of shifting America back to the left while he's
                        in office. It's entirely possible that we may not get the opportunity to elect more Democrats to office. There's a lot
                        to fear about the next four year, both culturally and politically, but in the meantime, while we still have a democracy,
                        I leave you with these questions to ponder.

                        I want to note this is not me critiquing democracy or suggesting 
                        anything philosophically about the nature of people or whatever, I am just expressing my frustration with the state
                        of the country. Ideology happens manifests itself cancerously within our government, and this isn't a new phenomenon.
                        People have always been a plague in opposition to efficiency, and this election is but further evidence of that.
                        When presented with a better world, you will always have people who complain that it costed too much.
