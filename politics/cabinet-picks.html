                    We've received our first official glimpse of the upcoming Trump presidency, and it's not looking good.
                    Trump's cabinet picks, or at least his suggestions, are appalling. Trump's ability to exceed even 
                    our worst expectations is genuinely funny in a cynical sort of way. 
                    But these aren't just any generic bad cabinet picks, they are exceptionally so, 
                    to the point of being interesting. These picks weren't made in ignorance, they were made with a deliberate 
                    goal in mind. So, how did we get here?
                </p>
                <br>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <p>
                    Trump's goal in nominating rapists, criminals, and television hosts (like himself) to government 
                    positions serves two purposes. Firstly, and less controversially, Trump is nominating people who will be
                    absolutely loyal to him. Secondly, and less substantially in all honesty, Trump is trying gain authority
                    and legitimacy in the public eye with these picks. The former is far more terrifying, and is likely indicative
                    of the authoritarianism to come under his administration. The latter, while still greatly concerning, is
                    indicative of something more subtle and complex within America, a vehement anti-intellectualism plaguing
                    the working class of this country.

                    Trump nominating dangerously unqualified people to cabinet positions only serves to reinforce his power over
                    the federal government. Rather than sensibly picking talented individuals who will accomplish meaningful things,
                    Trump has purposefully picked people who, frankly, have no business being anywhere near government.
                    Elon Musk, Marco Rubio, Robert Kennedy Jr., Pete Hegseth, and more all have one thing in common,
                    they're Trump fanatics. These are people who, at Trump's word, will fall to their knees in obedience.
                    And this is what Trump is looking for out of the people closest to him. Trump wants to establish a 
                    oligarchy of loyal minions that will unquestionably aid him in destroying the country in whatever way he pleases.
                    After all, these are a group of people that have otherwise been rejected and ignored by society, and Trump 
                    giving them what might be their last grand opportunity in government will be his ticket into gaining
                    complete control over these departments. Why do you need a qualified, highly educated person for the role
                    of Department of Education when you can have someone who will mindlessly follow your every command?

                <p>
                    The implications that this might have on policy is terrifying to think about. We've reached a point where
                    the people who are in charge of the country no longer care about genuine improvement, only in enacting
                    a regime that will only serve to satisfy their own interests.

                    I think that we can make an interesting argument about <i>how</i> exactly this happened in the first place.
                    How did American turn into a place where we could allow this to happen? To let someone like Trump into the
                    presidency (again) and let him makes these nominations? At what point did we decide that we no longer value
                    qualified and capable people running the country and would instead rather have a plutocracy of liars who 
                    play into the emotions of the public for their own benefit?

                <p>
                    At least with the first Trump presidency, Republicans had something of an excuse to justify electing him
                    to office. How could we have known just how arrogant and misinformed his administration would be? Some of us
                    were sensible, yes, but generally speaking most people lacked the foresight to understand just what they were
                    signing up for. This time, however, it's hard to make that same argument. I suppose that you might look at
                    your choices and say "well, Biden's presidency was rough, maybe we should go back to the old guy" (however
                    ignorant that view may be), but how could any sensible person look at Trump's agenda and the events of 
                    January 6, 2021, and still make the decision to vote for Trump?

                    I want to offer my explanation for what has changed in America. This isn't exactly an empirical argument,
                    it's mostly just a personal observation and expression of frustration with a vague trend that I've noticed.

                    Conservatism possesses, at its core, a habit to reject progress. It is arguably the defining characteristic
                    of the movement. Usually, at an institutional level, this rejection is motivated by either by mundane
                    financial or economic desires, or, more dangerously, a desire to preserve certain social standards.
                    Slavery is a great example of this, as the South's rejection of abolition was motivated both by the 
                    economic prospect of losing their free labor, and a desire to maintain a racial hierarchy.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Both of these traits can be effectively summarized by a distrust or rejection of establishment or institutions.
                    This is an obvious characteristic of Conservatism, but what I'm interested in is its relation to anti-intellectualism.
                    Science, or synonymously the process of science, as an institution, exists in opposition the belief held by many
                    conservatives that they know more about the world than some elite group of "others" that they have
                    no personal relation to. An excellent example of this was the vaccine distrust that was (moderately) widespread during
                    the Covid pandemic. Many held the belief that they, in their infinite wisdom and hubris, knew more about the virus than
                    medical experts, thus eliminating the necessity of vaccination, especially at the hands of the government,
                    let alone one ran by Democrats. And this is a general trend which is clearly visible on many political
                    matters. It's irrelevant that research is in relative agreement that immigrants are a net positive for the 
                    country(*), all Republicans hear is Trump's violent shouting about how immigrants are stealing your jobs and
                    kill and raping their way through the country.    
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                    (*) There's a valid point to be made that this belief is due, in part, by the inaccessibility of science as a medium,
                    but that's a topic for another day. 
                </p>
            </div>

                    This perspective on science plays into how Trump has managed so far to get away with his cabinet picks, and more broadly
                    how he managed to gain political power in the first place. It's no coincidence that many of Trump's cabinet picks are
                    either famous in the political sense or famous pop-culturally. I think that Trump is looking to derive legitimacy
                    through these nominations. For the average person, it's much more understandable to nominate a famous and successful
                    business person like Elon Musk to a position of power than to nominate some obscure government official with 
                    legitimate experience, since for these people wealth and fame is enough of a qualification to do anything. Again,
                    this is emblematic of a distrust in authority, and this is the so idea that Trump ran off of back in 2016. Trump
                    advertised himself as a Washington outsider, someone who would bring his business experience to the federal 
                    government, as if that automatically qualified him to run the country. And this worked, because it's more digestible
                    for your average person than the usual policy proposals.

                    It turns out that asking people to "just be smarter" is not a very sound political strategy, so instead it looks
                    like Democrats have a serious rhetoric problem that needs to be sorted out. It's not a difficult one either I believe,
                    often times many liberal positions can be argued in a way which appropriately appeals to a conservative audience.
                    One position that I am more passionate about is abolishing the death penalty. While conservatives might be
                    riled at that idea (somewhat contradictory, so much for distrusting authority), the most convincing arguments
                    supporting it is that, on average, cases involving the death penalty cost more taxpayer money to convict than a simple 
                    life imprisonment sentence. If we want more Democrat victories, this might be the poison that we have to swallow,
                    sacrificing our assumption of moral superiority to play along with conservative mind games.
                    But besides that, the issue that Republicans is much more concerning. I don't expect Republicans to have the same
                    kind of reflection over their decision to throw away democracy over inflation, and  I'm not sure if there's anything 
                    that we can do at this point to remedy such a substantial blow to our country at this point, so I end leaving
                    you with the same anxieties polluting my brain. Have fun.
