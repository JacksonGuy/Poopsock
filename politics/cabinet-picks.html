            <h1> The reality of Trump's cabinet </h1>

            <div class="row">
                <p>
                    We've received our first official glimpse of the upcoming Trump presidency, and it's not looking good.
                    Trump's cabinet picks, or suggestions at least for now, are, in a word, appalling. It's incredible the ability
                    that Trump possesses to, despite our worst expectations, to still exceed them in their awfulness. These aren't
                    just any generic bad cabinet picks, they are exceptionally so, to the point of being interesting. These picks
                    weren't made in ignorance, they were made with a deliberate goal in mind. So, how did we get here, and what 
                    was Trump's goal with these picks?
                </p>

            <div class="row">
                <p>
                    Trump's goal with nominating rapists, criminals, and television hosts (like himself) to government 
                    positions serves two purposes. Firstly, and less controversially, Trump is nominating people who will be
                    absolutely loyal to him. Secondly, and less substantially in all honesty, Trump is hoping to gain authority
                    and legitimacy in the public eye with these picks. The former is far more terrifying, and is likely indicative
                    of the authoritarianism to come under his administration. The latter, while still greatly concerning, is
                    indicative of something more broad and complex within America, the vehement anti-intellectualism plaguing
                    the country.

                <p>
                    Trump nominating dangerously unqualified people to cabinet positions only serves to reinforce his power over
                    the federal government. Rather than sensibly picking talented individuals who will accomplish things in their
                    roles, Trump has purposefully picked people who, frankly, have no business being anywhere near government.
                    However, Elon Musk, Marco Rubio, Robert Kennedy Jr., Pete Hegseth, and more all have one thing in common,
                    they're Trump fanatics. These are people who, at Trump's word, will fall to their knees in obedience.
                    And this is what Trump is looking for out of the people closest to him. Trump wants to establish a 
                    narcissistic oligarchy that will unquestionably aid him in destroying the country in whatever way he pleases.
                    After all, these are a group of people that have otherwise been rejected and ignored by society, and Trump 
                    giving them their grand opportunity to have lasting change in the world will be his ticket into
                    complete control over these departments. Why do you need a qualified, highly education person for the role
                    of Department of Education when you can have someone who will mindlessly follow your every command?

                    “Totalitarianism in power invariably replaces all first-rate talents, regardless of their sympathies, with those 
                    crackpots and fools whose lack of intelligence and creativity is still the best guarantee of their loyalty.”
